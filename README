In Place Editable
=================

Easy mode REST-ful in place editing. Currently jQuery only. Usage:

* Install the plugin with "ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/leethal/in-place-editable.git" (or add it as a submodule if you like).
* Run "rake in_place_editable:copy_javascripts"
* Make sure you load the javascript in your layout. E.g. <%= javascript_include_tag "jquery", "in_place_editable", "application" %>
* Use it in your views with <%= in_place_editable(@post, :title) %>.

Similar to form for, you can pass an array. <%= in_place_editable([:admin, @project, @task], :description) %>.
